# The Why
As someone who plans to work in tech, I need to be on top of whichever tech stack that my company uses, and the only person responsible for that is myself. I think that being able to perform well at work starts with discipline. Now that I have some time for myself, I should sprinkle in some time for work in between my resting hours. Especially because this opportunity won't come again any time soon.

This will also be a good opportunity for me to learn more about my own working styles and shortcomings. And I can experiment with different timings and figure out what works best for me.
# What does disciplined work look like?
How I imagine disciplined work looks like is just working despite the lack of motivation. I know that I am someone who is prone to get demotivated literally all the time. On top of that, I tend to have a one-track mind, meaning I find it hard to actually get everything I need to do, done. I think disciplined work looks like this - starting work at the same time, and ending at the same time. Taking appropriate breaks and managing stress while doing so. Right now, stress isn't really a factor because I'm the only one who's keeping count. But I need to be able to take this seriously.
# The Plan
As of right now, I think that I'm going to first try time blocking, and experimenting and finding out my ideal working times. As of January, I don't have anything going for me, so I'll set my "work" as just programming some personal projects and learning new things.

I think I'll start with time blocking and see where to go from there.
