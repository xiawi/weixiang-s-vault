## [[Binary Search]]
### A better way to search
#### Exercises
1. **Suppose you have a sorted list of 128 names, and you’re searching through it using binary search. What’s the maximum number of steps it would take?**
   It would take a maximum of $log_{2}128 = 7$ steps.
2. **Suppose you double the size of the list. What’s the maximum number of steps now?**
   Eight, since binary search effectively halves the search space each loop-through.
