# The philosophy of Git branches
To allow users to work on different parts of a project without impacting the main branch. When work on a new branch is completed, it can be **merged** into the main one. We can also switch between branches and work on different branches without interfering with each other.
# Commands
- `git branch <branch-name>` - to create new branch
- `git branch` - to view existing branches
- `git checkout <branch-name>` - to switch to a new branch
