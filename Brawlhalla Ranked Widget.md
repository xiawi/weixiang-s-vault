**2025-01-15**
Started looking into how to get the widget done. Decided to go with vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Looking into efficiently querying data from the server via HTTP GET requests through vanilla js. I think I may need to rethink and redefine how I want to make this work. I think going with vanilla for this project is a good idea, because it is my first project from the list and will hopefully prime me for whatever framework I end up having to learn.
