Last night's sleep was great, but I've awoken feeling more sore than usual. I probably overworked myself yesterday, playing volleyball and basketball. It's honestly not a terrible feeling but I can feel it in my thighs. The workers are coming in for renovations again soon. I've forgotten how annoying it is to have to share bathrooms.

I woke up at 8, and once in the middle of the night, I think. But I feel relatively refreshed. Today, I'm going to KL with Gladys to check out her workplace, and we'll walk around KL for a bit. Then, I'll go for a haircut with Wai Cheng and Marcus. Marcus and I were planning to shoot some hoops after we grab dinner.

Hmm..

No dreams last night. No real thoughts at the moment. Hopefully journaling will help me structure my thoughts a little better.

We have finally submitted the video for the distributed systems assignment, after so long.
