Gladys and I got intimate last night. It was really nice. The sleep was really good too. I didn't even want to wake up. This morning, we brushed our teeth and I showered. Then, Gladys made me hash browns, and I ate them up quickly.

I don't really have any plans today, I think. Gladys is working on some stuff for her internship, and I should do some of my own studying, but I also want to just take a rest day today, even though I've been taking plenty of them this week. Can you blame me though? I feel like I don't really want to jump back into getting busy again after 3 years of university. But I also want to complete my [[30 Projects before 30]] list before I reach 30 years old. I'm sort of just tired at the moment, so maybe I'll just rest today. Gotta have balance between work and rest.

I'm staying over at Glad's tonight again, and we might go out to look at some wardrobes at the IKEA nearby. I hope I don't end up tiring her out too much. I feel tired just doing nothing.
