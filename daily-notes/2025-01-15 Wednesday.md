I missed my journaling session last night. I have to be very careful to not let this habit slip right now, because this happens a lot, where I slowly become more and more inconsistent and then one day I just stop trying. Okay, today is a new day. New start.

Yesterday's sleep was decent. I showered with Gladys, it's been a while since we had the chance to be intimate with one another. She looked amazing as always. We had a lot of kisses and hugs. It was very sweet. Gladys took up some of Christopher's work and I feel like it's taking up a lot of her time outside of work. That is a little annoying in my opinion because I feel like I'm just watching her make the same mistake over and over again where she chooses to help someone when she also has her own shit to deal with. Hopefully they can clear this up, I feel like I can't even spend time with my girlfriend after a whole day of not seeing her.

What's the plan today? I have no real plan today. I think I'm gonna just continue studying [[Git]], and maybe start looking into Vim. Found a couple texts that I want to get into yesterday. I should also really just start a coding project, and maybe think about how to block out my time throughout the day.

I'm thinking what's important is that I have a few hours of actual programming and a few hours of study, where I can study anything, whether it relates to programming or not. I guess I'll do that today and try to figure out what works for me throughout the next few weeks.

Today was sort of productive, but I have yet to begin on my actual time blocking for my [[Disciplining Work]] action plan. I studied a little bit of [[Pro Git]] and Vim, and started one of the projects in my 30 projects list: The Brawlhalla Ranked Widget.

I realize that I'm actually pretty useless when it comes to programming from scratch, and that I heavily rely on generative AI, especially at the beginning of projects. I really want to work this out of myself. So, I started and restarted my project. Now I have some bare JavaScript and a scrappy HTML file. It's looking very ugly, but I think I need to work on understanding how JavaScript works before I can really build this well.

I've decided that I should really just stick to vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript for this project, as it would sort of be my first time actually building something that I would want to use for myself.

I went out with Marcus today. We went to his workplace, the Lil' Ninjas Dojo, where we sort of just sat around and worked on our own shit. He was working on some stuff for the Dojo and I was just studying/working on my project. It was relatively productive.

But damn, I really need to work on my own programming. I feel like I'm far from the developer that I would want to be.

I'm sleeping over at Glad's again tonight. I'm hoping that we can get intimate. It's actually been so long and I've been in heat for a while now. It's just that I feel so sleepy when it gets late. Hopefully this doesn't end up ruining our relationship. She's still working on Chris' work right now. I'm in her bed typing this.

On another note, my eczema is getting worse. I think it's due to the renovations happening. The dusty environment is not a good match for my already bone-dry skin. I'm hoping that they can finish soon so that I don't have to deal with it anymore. My hands have been dryer than ever, wounds still raw and I literally have no choice but to accept that this is the way things are when the environment gets all fucky. Life is unfair, man. Having eczema on the hands actually makes me so sad. I feel like I can't live a normal life. Like people are able to hold a pen without feeling like their fingers are falling off. I want that, man.

Okay, enough rambling about eczema. My thoughts are literally all over the place right now, and that's something that I hope that journaling will help me deal with. I hope that through this process, I'll learn to organize my thoughts better and be able to think more cohesively.
