I missed my journaling session last night. I have to be very careful to not let this habit slip right now, because this happens a lot, where I slowly become more and more inconsistent and then one day I just stop trying. Okay, today is a new day. New start.

Yesterday's sleep was decent. I showered with Gladys, it's been a while since we had the chance to be intimate with one another. She looked amazing as always. We had a lot of kisses and hugs. It was very sweet. Gladys took up some of Christopher's work and I feel like it's taking up a lot of her time outside of work. That is a little annoying in my opinion because I feel like I'm just watching her make the same mistake over and over again where she chooses to help someone when she also has her own shit to deal with. Hopefully they can clear this up, I feel like I can't even spend time with my girlfriend after a whole day of not seeing her.

What's the plan today? I have no real plan today. I think I'm gonna just continue studying [[Git]], and maybe start looking into Vim. Found a couple texts that I want to get into yesterday. I should also really just start a coding project, and maybe think about how to block out my time throughout the day.

I'm thinking what's important is that I have a few hours of actual programming and a few hours of study, where I can study anything, whether it relates to programming or not. I guess I'll do that today and try to figure out what works for me throughout the next few weeks.
