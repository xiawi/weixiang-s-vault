A bit of a late log today. I woke up at around 8 AM, lazed around in bed for a bit and had breakfast before going out to shoot some hoops with Marcus. My hands sort of sting at the moment, not sure if that's due to the friction from the ball or just poorly cut nails. I tried the apple juice Ji Chuan recommended me too. It's a little too slimy for me, but it wasn't terrible.

They're polishing the floors downstairs today, so I'll probably just be up here for most of the day, save for lunch and dinner. I'm meeting Gladys for dinner tonight! We're getting BONES. It's been a while since we last got it.

I guess it's a little bit of a late start today. I'm thinking I'll do a little studying on [[Grokking Algorithms|DSA]] first. And after that we'll see what's coming. I'm enjoying [[Grokking Algorithms]]. I kinda want to play a little Minecraft too. Maybe I'll do that after they finish hanging my whiteboard. Hopefully that'll go well.
