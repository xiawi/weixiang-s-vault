So, I went for a badminton session with my friends last night, completely destroying my planned sleep schedule. But this was accounted for, an exception, not a rule. Today is a new day, with new goals. I would like to begin on my sleep disciplining work plan. Starting with unwinding by 9.

Today also marks a new day of just waking up in normal human hours. I woke up at 8, because they're beginning to do renovations in my room. I'm also journaling now in the morning, which is good.

I did not end up learning Git yesterday. Despite switching to Linux, I still find myself getting distracted by a bunch of stuff (games, YouTube videos, movies or shows). Which is to be expected, because that's the kind of user that I am. However, I'm hoping to be a little more mindful with how I use my computer.
