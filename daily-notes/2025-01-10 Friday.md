Finally started doing something today, tried installing Arch Linux to a wall of failure. I could not figure out why connecting a second monitor caused my laptop audio output to disappear. Guess I'll try again next year.

I'm about to complete my degree, finally. Took me long enough. Just need my group mates to complete their parts and we can submit our video and put all of this behind us (if all things go well).

I really need to get my shit together. This year, I need to get more disciplined. Me writing about this at 1 AM probably isn't a great look, but still. I need to come up with an action plan, and read more, and do more. But before that, I really need to start with sleep.

# To-do
- [x] Draft out action plan
- [x] Start learning Git
