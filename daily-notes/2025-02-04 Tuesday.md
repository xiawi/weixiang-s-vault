I have not written in this journal since last Friday. Here's a quick update. I'm trying to build the habit of going to the gym this month, a habit that I hope will last a lifetime, but realistically, who knows? Results will hopefully be visible by the end of the year, but the main thing is consistency. I'm hoping that I'm able to get muscular but also stay lean. Gaining strength and aesthetics.

Writing in the journal wasn't the only habit that slipped, I also barely did any studying for programming, or reading. Especially while we were travelling around so much. I'm not even writing this in the morning, it's after my gym session. It's 10 minutes from 4 PM right now! Slowly things will fall back into place. Things seem clearer now, and hopefully, I can achieve my goal of being more disciplined this year.

Prior to writing, I just started a course on Khan Academy on [[Financial Literacy]] that I hope will pan out well. Going to learn to manage money a little better. On top of that, I'm also starting to learn C programming, in an attempt to be a little more ready for [[42KL]]. Going to try to get my sleep discipline down as well. Hopefully, things'll get better now that I'm home. No more excuses.
