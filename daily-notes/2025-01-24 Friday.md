Progress on disciplining sleep has literally been completely reset. I slept at fucking 7 AM this morning. After the kickboxing session with Gabriel and Jia Le, I was completely beat. We went to a mamak for some food, and I made the mistake of getting a Teh Ais. I couldn't sleep, but the worst part was that I had no discipline to put my phone down.

Fuck me. 7 AM. I woke up at 4 PM. Who does that?

What's done is done but I should really try to be more disciplined. I'll start again today. As you can imagine, there really isn't much that I can get done. But I do want to get started on reading for a while. I need to get my shit together.
