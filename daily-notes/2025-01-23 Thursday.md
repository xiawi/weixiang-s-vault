I did not end up journaling last night. I was a little too tired to do anything. Nothing productive was really done yesterday. I felt like I couldn't bring myself to do anything. I wasted most of it on watching YouTube videos. Gladys and I got dinner, and after I fetched her home, I saw some people passing a volleyball around at the park nearby and joined them for a bit. When I got home, I was just tired as hell. Brushed my teeth, got ready for bed and just slept.

Late start today. It's like 1 AM as I'm typing this. I probably woke up around 12-ish. They installed my whiteboard in my room. I can use it to practice for my coding interviews. And just having a whiteboard is pretty awesome, to be honest. I should come up with a work plan for getting back into work. Also, I'm thinking of moving my journaling offline, onto an actual physical journal. I kinda feel like my handwriting will deteriorate without practice, and I should really try my best not to let that happen. Maybe I'll start some time next month, though.
