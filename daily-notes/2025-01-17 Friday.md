Gladys and I sort of got intimate yesterday, but it wasn't exactly what I expected. I still loved it, don't get me wrong. I realize how little we can do when my hands are all fucked up, and the fact that renovations are going means that I can't really properly heal with all this dry dust kicking up everywhere. So I'm just gonna try to do my own thing. I want to leave the house, but I also have no place to go at the moment. Sort of annoying.

Because of these stupid renovations and the WiFi going down. I think I just have to accept that I've already been as productive as I can this week. I feel like trying to do more in this dusty ass environment is going to make my hands feel much worse, so I'd rather just fuck off and try to relax a little more for now.

In terms of what I'm going to do today. The only thing that I know is gonna happen is that I'm meeting Justin for the first time in a while. We're getting Menya Hanabi's mazesoba. I've been craving it for a while. I guess I'm a little excited for that. But besides that, there's nothing else going on.
