I didn't journal last night (again). Looks like this hobby is just slipping, huh? Anyway, we slept pretty late last night. Gladys was working on her internship tasks til like 11 PM and I was just playing some mobile games on her bed. I think we hit the bed around 12:30 AM, 4-ish hours before she has to wake up and get prepped for work. The sleep was maybe a 4/10. She's definitely tired, and I'm still feeling pretty groggy and unenergized.

Today, I'll be meeting Gabriel, Cheryl and Jia Le at Sunway with Gladys. The current plan is to go to university some time after lunch and get some work done there. I'm not too sure if we're able to move in today, but I'm hoping they'll be done with everything at the very least. I miss my room very much, my setup, my bed, my books. So many things taken for granted.

Over the course of this week, I realize that there's actually just too much to learn in terms of programming. It wasn't exactly a revelation, I mean most students of programming know this, but I never really felt the weight of it all until last week. I don't understand the network stack, the HTTP protocol, the languages I want to use, etc. I don't know the powers of vanilla JS, how to start a project from scratch, how to even pick what I want to work with. There's too much to learn, and I think I should start with a simple one.

Since I'm currently working on the [[Brawlhalla Ranked Widget]], which should be done in vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I'm thinking of just learning JavaScript first and coding as I go.
