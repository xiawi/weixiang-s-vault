My fucking god, fixing my sleep schedule is proving to be harder than I thought. I know what some of the components of the problem are - using my phone before bed, not having a proper bedtime routine, and an overall lack of discipline. It isn't fair to pin all the blame on myself though, the constant travelling experienced this week makes it a little difficult to even have a routine.

Today, we're travelling to Sekinchan, my mother's hometown. Meeting some uncles, aunts and cousins. I used to be a lot closer to them but things have since died down for a long time. I used to look forward to meeting my cousins, but these past few years, I've just been dreading it.

I need to lock in. First month is already over and I've barely got anything started yet.
