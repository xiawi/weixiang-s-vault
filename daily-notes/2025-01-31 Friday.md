We're going back home today from Sekinchan. I'm excited to be home and resting. Hopefully there'll be time to visit Gladys by the time we reach home. Today, we're gonna have lunch with the extended family. With my cousins and aunts and uncles.

There isn't much planned for today. I can't really read at the back of the car, it's extremely bumpy and we're packed like sardines back there. It's a little too uncomfortable for my liking, and I can't do anything that requires focus. I'll most probably just be on my phone again, as I have for the rest of this week.

I need to discipline myself a little, but I also need to allow myself time. This shit is fucking hard with all this travelling, requests, etc. Give me a fucking break man.
