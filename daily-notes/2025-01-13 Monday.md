Last night's sleep was sort of not great, to be honest. Gladys has a very small bed and I think it's a little hard to maintain a sleep schedule when I'm with her. We talked a lot before we slept. She was very nervous about starting her internship today. We also talked about setting Wai Cheng up with Madeleine. I think she sees it happening. I hope it happens, although I don't need it to.

I was supposed to meet Fong today, but I think that we'll be cancelling. He didn't sleep at 5 AM last night. I should also book an appointment for the dentist to fix my teeth. It's been a while since my last visit. I'm a little lazy to start doing that, to be honest, but one of my teeth have been kinda messed up for a while, and I need to get that fixed ASAP.

My Git studying has been relatively slow, but today will be a slower day, and I'm hoping that I'll be able to do a little more. 

Oh my god, also, my hands have been more fucked up than ever. They hurt like crazy, and I think all the dust being kicked up from renovations, and my constant contact with rough surfaces like basketballs aren't helping. I think I should lay off balls for a little bit to let my eczema calm down. I hope that it'll be better by Saturday and I can hit the volleyball court again.
