Early morning today. Although it wasn't exactly an early night. It is currently 7:30 AM. I've had my breakfast, which had a surprisingly high calorie content, and a lot of fat (probably from my half cup of nuts). Today, there really isn't any plans, per se. I have yet to start on my [[Disciplining Work]] plans, as in, I haven't blocked in time for "work" yet. Right now, all I'm doing is studying whenever I want to.

What I'm realizing though, is that trying to adopt new habits and routines sort of force me to fix the ones that I've been struggling with. For example, sleep has been a big struggle for the whole month of January. Yes, there were renovations, lots of travelling, and whatnot, and I've used these excuses to basically say that "January was a dud". Honestly, though, after starting to workout, albeit it's only been like 3 days, I'm finding improvements in this area.

I don't feel exactly 100% awake at the moment, but I definitely have felt worse. 

I've spent so much money this month, even though it's just started. I really need to keep it under control. I bought headphones, a phone stand, shaving gel, nasal strips, chicken breast, and a sachet of protein powder. Individually, I don't think those things are too high in cost, save for the headphones maybe, but they add up so quickly. How the hell do adults do this, man. I'm supposed to be an adult now.
