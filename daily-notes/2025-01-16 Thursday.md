Last night's sleep was a 5/10. I'm feeling a little groggy, but I'm rested enough that I don't feel like I need to sleep right now. A healthy middle. Now that I think about it, it's been a while since I had like a full 10/10 fully rested sleep. I feel as though my body is just used to having subpar sleep now. After all these renovations get done, I'm going to have a nice long sleep.

Today, I have a dental appointment with the family's regular dentist. I have no idea what to prepare for, but I am going alone for the first time. I hope that I'll be able to drive after. I'm not sure what he'll do to me later or if I require surgery. I do have a cavity. We'll find out later, I suppose.

I suppose today is as good a time as any to start trying time blocking. I'm not too sure where I should go to do work. Home is dusty and dirty, and our WiFi has been having issues since last night. I think I'll head out to do work today. I may skip on this, though as my average day doesn't really include a 9-10 block for a dental appointment.

Starting a project is surprisingly overwhelming. I'm not sure how to begin, and there aren't really any instructions for how to approach it. I think I just need to accept that I'm not the programmer I want to be right now, and study what I need to study. Gotta keep my head down and just do the work.

Gladys and I didn't end up doing anything last night. I get it. Internship is tiring, and I think both of us was just feeling sleepy. I'm still very much in heat, but I need to control myself.
