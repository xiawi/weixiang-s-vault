I forgot to journal this morning again. I was planning to sleep in, but renovations aren't exactly done yet. Most of today was just lazing around, getting horny, and just masturbating. Shameful behaviour, honestly. But I shouldn't really be sugarcoating stuff in here anyway. I finally have my setup complete and able to run. In fact, I'm typing this note on my mechanical keyboard (finally).

Renovations are a fucking pain, no one can convince me otherwise. Anyway, yeah. Nothing much happened today. I helped move some stuff around, but that's pretty much it from a productivity perspective. Now that I got my room back, I can finally get back to [[Disciplining Sleep]]. Or at least, that is what I think should happen.

Honestly, Chinese New Year is around the corner, and I feel like time just does not want to work with me right now. The time that I had to fix my sleep, the renovations were occurring. Literally one week after, we'll be going out as a family. Chinese New Year, too. We're gonna be sleeping late as fuck. See, this is what I mean. I'm not busy, but I can't actually work on myself because of this bullshit. Whatever.
