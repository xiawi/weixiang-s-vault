I forgot to do journaling last night, as well as this morning. I played volleyball today with Chris' gang, Ji Chuan, Jia Le, and Wai Cheng. It's been a while since I've seen Wai Cheng play, but he definitely still has it in him. He had some killer spikes today. Jia Le and Ji Chuan is improving steadily as well. Hopefully they'll continue to come and we can all improve together.

After volleyball in the morning, I had lunch with Jia Le and Ji Chuan at Atria's KFC. I drove Ji Chuan there from the BU3 Community Hall. The double down is permanently returning. It tastes so damn good. Ji Chuan treated me to lunch. I should get the next bill. Jia Le went home after lunch, and Ji Chuan and I walked around Atria for a bit, talking about a bunch of stuff. At one point, we had a relatively long conversation about volleyball. I'm glad that he's getting into it.

After that, I had to fetch Gladys from Madeleine's house. So, I dropped Ji Chuan back at the community hall to get his car, and went off to pick Gladys up. As I'm typing this, we just reached her home. Her mom just reached home as well.
