I did not log a journal entry for the whole of yesterday. I woke up late and was preoccupied with watching 'Creature Commandos, and before I knew it, the day was already over. I slept pretty late, probably around 4 AM, which was admittedly quite stupid, especially since we were gonna travel today. This morning, I struggled to wake up, and felt sick on the trip to Ipoh. 

Upon arriving, I didn't even eat lunch, I was so tired I just fell asleep in grandma's room. My family went to the hotel before me, because I was so deep in sleep, I couldn't even bring myself to wake up.

Writing this after waking up, and in the hotel. It is already 6:47 PM as I'm writing this. Might as well be a night entry. Anyway, today's the eve of Chinese New Year, in case I forget why we were travelling down to Ipoh anyway.
