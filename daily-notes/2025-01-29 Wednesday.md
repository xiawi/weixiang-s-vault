The family slept relatively late last night. I probably slept around 2 AM, literally just doing nothing. I had a realization last night in the shower (the best place for realizations). I thought of intentional living before, which, to me, means that everything is done with a valid purpose and reasoning behind it. It doesn't have to be perfect reasoning, it doesn't have to be necessarily correct in a normal sense. But the reasoning has to come from yourself and no one else.

The realization I had last night ties quite closely to this idea. Which can be summed up into one phrase: "How you do anything is how you do everything." Definitely not an original thought. In fact, I'm pretty sure I heard it from an anime at one point. But it should apply to me, and I should be more aware of how I do things.

Some things like using my phone before sleeping, entails that I'm not really giving 100% of my focus to sleep. I'm just passing the time until I get tired. Or if I don't go for that spike when the setter's done their best. I'm not giving 100%. The goal is to always give my 100%. 

This should apply to everything, not just sleep, volleyball, or working out. It should apply to the way I work as well. I'm thinking of starting another one of my projects. Maybe a portfolio website, with an easier way for me to post about my future work and whatnot. Maybe some blogging space would be nice too. I should consider how to do this properly.

We're finally home after a long drive from Ipoh. Everyone's beat. I've missed Gladys, and right now I'm extremely horny for no reason whatsoever. I think I've been consuming too much dirty content. I want her so bad.

Tomorrow we're driving down to Sekinchan, and I'm probably gonna zone out again much like I did in Ipoh. These days are just passing by. It doesn't really feel like Chinese New Year. This lip pimple/ulcer is hurting like a motherfucker. I don't really know what I'm supposed to do with it. It stings.
