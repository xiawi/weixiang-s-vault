# 01 The Start Line
> "Everything should be made as simple as possible, not simpler."
> Albert Einstein

**As a beginner,** as long as
1. Caloric intake is in the ballpark of maintenance,
2. Protein intake is adequate,
3. Progressive overload is done with lifts,
You're mostly going to be gucci.

## Understanding Recomposition
Body recomp refers to reducing body fate percentage alongside increasing lean body mass.

Nippard and Barakat expand the definition of body recomposition to include three possible scenarios:
1. You build muscle while simultaneously losing fat.
2. You build muscle mass while maintaining body fat mass.
3. You lose fat while maintaining muscle mass.

## Mandatory Tools
### Weighing Scale
- Weigh as soon as you wake up, after using the bathroom before drinking any water or eating food.
### Measuring Tape
- Waist Circumference: Take measurements consistently. Either at the belly button or the smallest site on the waist. Weigh in 4-7 days a week and calculate averages to compare between weeks.
- Other Body  Measurements: Measure at the largest site on the muscle. Record both left and right measurements to track asymmetry.
	- Measure once every month.
