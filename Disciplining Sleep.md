# The Why
Sleep is an important factor of life, and I need to be able to keep it under control, especially when things begin to get hectic. I need to regain control of my sleep schedule, so that I can feel more energised and ready to take on daily challenges. Now that I no longer have university classes to wake up to, I need to make sure that my schedule becomes healthy. When I was doing uni, I spent so many nights just doing random bullshit, and ended up getting subpar quality of sleep and little to no energy during the days. I need to make the shift now that I have the opportunity to.
# What does disciplined sleep look like?
To me, at the very least, disciplined sleep is a structured way of sleeping; going to bed and waking at the same time every day, regardless of any external factors. There may be days that I need to sleep a little later, or wake up a little earlier, but these should be exceptions, not the rule.
# The Plan
I would like to set up good morning and night routines into my day, but slowly work them in instead of trying everything at once. I also need to find out when I should wake up, and what timings would be the most suitable for my lifestyle.
## Timings
### Wake
I think that it makes sense to start here, so I will. Assuming that my work in the future will be an 8 to 5 job, and that it takes me one hour to wake myself up, and another to drive to the workplace. I think that the ideal waking time should be **6 AM**, but this assumes that all that I will be doing in the morning is getting up and getting ready for work. Realistically, this would mean that I have an hour of me-time in the morning before work every weekday. I'm not sure what this really means.
I don't know if I want to go any earlier, since I may become tired in the afternoons. I think right now, I just have to experiment. We'll start with 6 AM waking times and work from there.
### Sleep
If we're doing 6 AM waking times, naturally we just go back 8 hours and find out when the "optimal" sleeping time would be. I think that **10 PM** is fine for now. If we go back to the job example, assuming that I leave work on time, and that it takes an hour to get home, I would have 7 PM - 10 PM of me time. Assuming that my night routine takes me an hour, realistically, I would only have 2 hours of time to do what I want every weekday.
I should think of how I want to spend those 2 hours later on.
## Routines
Now, we get to the actual hard part. I want to work some good habits into these routines, but I need to find the right habits to slowly ease myself into them.
